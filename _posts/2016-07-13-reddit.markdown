If you&rsquo;re a Pokémon Go player and fan/user of Reddit, you're in luck!
Reddit has some nice resources for trainers.

The main [/r/pokemongo](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo) subreddit is rapidly
growing and quickly turning into a great discussion forum and space to figure
out the intricacies of Pokémon Go.

## Regional Subreddits

/r/pokemongo has put together an awesome list of regional subreddits. Hop over
to their [regionalsubs](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/wiki/regionalsubs)
wiki page for more!

## Team Subreddits

There are subreddits for each of the three Pokémon Go teams:

  * **Valor** (red): [/r/PokemonGOValor](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGOValor)
  * **Mystic** (blue): [/r/PokemonGOMystic](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGOMystic)
  * **Instinct** (yellow): [/r/PokemonGOYellow](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGOYellow)

Go hang out and strategize! &hellip;or talk about animating logos. Whatever&rsquo;s
hip these days.

## Others

  * **[/r/PokemonGoStories](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGoStories)** for fun
  stories of Pokémon Go adventures
  * **[/r/PokemonGoSnap](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGoSnap)** to see and
  share photos taken in Pokémon Go

That&rsquo;s it for today! I&rsquo;ll keep this list updated if/when more Reddit
resources pop up.
